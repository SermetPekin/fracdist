# fracdist

## Description

This is a library to calculate p-values and critical values for tests of
fractional unit roots and cointegration.

This program is modelled on that described in James G. MacKinnon and Morten
Ørregaard Nielsen, "Numerical Distribution Functions of Fractional Unit Root
and Cointegration Tests," *Journal of Applied Econometrics*, Vol. 29, No. 1,
2014, pp.161-171.  The data in this repository is exactly that from the data
archive associated with the paper,
http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/datasets/mackinnon004/

## Requirements

This program requires perl, CMake, Eigen3 and Boost to compile, but has no
special runtime requirements.

## Building

See [COMPILING](BUILDING.md).
